0,Oh god rammus or shen or seju with that  shit …. Or …. Or … KAT
1,And then they start doing absolute damage.
2,Next patch: Truer Omega Damage.
3,I feel like that’s really just flat damage resistance
4,"There is too much true damage overall in the game, it's not just Vayne. True armor would work but I think only if it was a ""mythic"" item that granted like 5-10% true damage reduction."
5,"Shields. 

Vayne can't kill me through my fimblrwinter steraks spirit Visage gargoyles build. I got no hp. Just S H I E L D S"
6,Must be mundo steroids!!
7,"So, HP?"
8,"You mean, health?"
9,True armor is actually a good idea/interactor. But like it has to be unique for some champs to counter vayne ect. I mean it shouldnt be a common item that we can buy any day to another week.
10,"True damage should be reserved exclusively for ultimates.

% max health true damage should be removed entirely.

No, tanks won't be broken with the reduction of true damage. Armor shred and lethality exist for a reason. You shouldn't get to invalidate 100% of what the enemy built."
11,"They should call it like ""Thick hide"" or something."
12,You mean fimblewinter?
13,Old poppy
14,"Riot Games: Greetings Summoners! Now that we have added true armor, it is time to divide true damage into physical true damage and magical true damage! That's right, true armor only works against physical true damage, and as of yet we have no true magic resist in the game. Take care out there!

- League of Legends development and balance team probably"
15,True armor/mr exists as shields
16,so alistar r?
17,"AD is damage.  
AP is true damage.  
True damage is another true damage.  
Lethality is next another true damage."
18,"Honestly true damage is the one thing in the game that should not in any way shape won't be accessible outside of Champions

Kraken was it bad in the fact that it did true damage basically meaning that any ADC could shred any tank


It was needed at the time otherwise tanks were just going to go out of control but now that it's gone we're all better for it"
19,"True damage on Dota never gets crazy because scaling there is almost non-existing from the base value of the skill, and still they use it sparingly there, on League there are plenty of items and champions that have it."
20,What it should be called is “mitigation” should be both magic and armor… instead…
21,It's called health
22,I think that just health.
23,...Acid armor?
24,Wardens mail has entreated the chat.
25,Lethality is true armour
26,Is not mitigate damage by a %. True armor? And I’m pretty sure irelia w already did that.
27,Can't imagine crying about a champ that has 3 hit points. I am biased tho.
28,I feel like having a mythic that's whole point is to just reduce true damage a little bit would be nice
29,% damage reduction (like Garen W active)? That’d probably be the closest to a true damage counter
